Introduction
------------

AntsDB is a low latency, high concurrency virtual SQL layer for HBase. Unlike the other SQL on Hadoop solutions, AntsDB is aiming at making Hadoop a powerful OLTP database by providing complex transaction management capability, complete locking mechanism, sub millisecond latency and full compatibility with MySQL.


Features
--------
- ACID compliant. AntsDB supports read-committed isolation. Transaction can cross multiple table and multiple rows with automatic or manual commit/rollback. Updates is versioned using MVCC. Both optimistic locking and pessimistic locking are supported at the granularity of either table or row level.
- Core DML/DDL in MySQL flavour
- Secondary index.
- JDBC, ODBC, PHP, Python are supported using MySQL drivers
- Kerberos as the security mechanism
- Work with the popular MySQL frond-end such as MySQL Console, PhpMyAdmin, DBeaver, Squirrel SQL etc.

Requirements
------------
AntsDB requires Java 1.8. It runs on Linux, Windows and MacOS. It needs at leat 1G memory and 10G storage. 

Installation
------------
AntsDB executable can be either built using the source code or downloaded directly from www.antsdb.com. For details, please refer to the installation page on our wiki.

Security
--------
AntsDB shares the same security mechanism, Kerberos, with Hadoop/HBase. In order to enable the security. Your Hadoop/HBase cluster must be configure properly with Kerberos. When security is not enabled, user can log into AntsDB use any combination of user name and password.

Compatibility
-------------
AntsDB is wire compatible with MySQL. Most MySQL applications can run directly without any changes. 

Comparison to the Apache Phoenix
--------------------------------
Apache Phoenix is a popular SQL on HBase software. Though AntsDB and Phoenix both brings SQL to the HBase, they are targeting different use cases. Phoenix supports transaction and is a power query engine which can distribute workload on multiple nodes. AntsDB's focus is on latency and compatbility.
- AntsDB is wire compatible with MySQL so that it makes HBase accessable through JDBC, ODBC, PHP, PERL and all other language bindings available to MySQL
- AntsDB supports MySQL featuers and syntax thus many MySQL based applications and frameworks can run directly on HBase
- AntsDB uses local cache to save network traffic. It can be one order of magnitude faster than Phoenix for small query and transactions.
